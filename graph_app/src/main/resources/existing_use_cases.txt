Based on Chris' meeting invite for 26th June 20

Purpose:

We need everyone’s assistance with shaking the applications for bugs in the analytics dashboards.  Concretely, I want you to test the analytics to see if each 1) dashboard workflow works, 2) Identify any misspelling, 3) Identify possible UX improvements, 4)  Any missing data from tables that you expect, 5)  Report any drill downs that don’t make any sense, 6) any missing enrichment data, like geo or AD.

Overall Testing Process:

Check for misspells on the charts
Is there a legend for each chart
Does the legend make senses for the chart
Are there any unpleasant experiences with using the app or chart
Are you able to investigate a possible anomaly on the charts
Is the chart empty or are there gaps in the data on the chart
Are there any errors reports or unexpected messages
Are there any mixed values (like numbers and strings in an integer field)  in a column
Are there NULLs or NAs in the columns
Can you view the details of the report
Can you think of an easier/better to show the data in the charts

Your Output:

Document any discrepancies with any charts on a dashboard in a JIRA ticket
Provide steps to reproduce it
Feedback must reference a app and/or chart
If in doubt, document your feedback

ITD

    Select 3 users or entities from the risky tables and drilldown to the 360 User/IP view
    Review the Event List records to identify any missing (like no records) or obviously wrong information.


UEBA

    Select each UEBA, and ask yourself if the y and x values make sense for the high variance clusters?
    Can you drill down on a clustering centroid to do a search


Security Posture

    Select an indicator from the top and drill down to the detailed records.
    Does the result make sense
    Can you jump to search from this page
    Can you drill down on a specific UEBA


SOC Dashboard

    Can you investigate the risky users and entities by pivoting to 360 View or Search?


Statistical Dashboard

    Do the stats look accurate for users and entities
    Can you compare two records to contract their stats



Search

    Run a query over the last 7 days with SRC_HOST: john.white and SRC_IP: 192.168.5.53
    Run a query over the last 7 days with SRC_HOST: acmecl23 and SRC_TYPE: Sysmon and EVENT_ID
    Identify a value in the results returned by above queries and do a string search on the value.  Do you get results back?


360 Views

    View one user in 360 View
    View one entity in 360 View
